        <p>You ready to go?</p><p>Let me just finish this.</p><p>Hey, Ross. Check this out. Yeah, I can&#39;t do that.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Have you seen this? It&#39;s our new alumni website for college. You can post messages for people let everyone know what you&#39;re up to.</p><p>Oh, great. A faster way to tell people that I&#39;m unemployed and childless.</p><p>It&#39;s actually interesting to find out what people are doing. Remember Andrea Rich?</p><p>That tall girl that wouldn&#39;t sleep with you?</p><p>Well, her Internet company went under, and she lost an ear in a oating accident.</p><p>Bet she&#39;d sleep with you now.</p><p>No, I already e-mailed her.</p><p>Let me see what you wrote about yourself. Doctor of paleontology,two kids. Wait a second. You split with Carol because you had different interests? I think you split with Carol because you had one very similar interest.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.</p><p>Okay!</p><p>What, did you think you learned how to do it in the two minutes?</p><p>Maybe we finish this for him. Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She is now my girlfriend. I don&#39;t care what society says, it&#39;s the best sex I&#39;ve ever had. And send.</p><p>No, no-- You can&#39;t do that to him.</p><p>All right, let&#39;s go.</p><p>Dude!</p><p>I think you made it clear you can&#39;t be trusted with the ball inside the house.</p><p>And send.</p><p>Hey. How was basketball?</p><p>It was fun. Right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye.</p><p>Oh, no! Who did that?</p><p>Chandler. Yeah.</p><p>Hey!</p><p>Rach?</p><p>Yeah?</p><p>What&#39;s Huggsy doing in the crib with Emma?</p><p>She was just crawling around and found him, so I just let her sleep with him.</p><p>That&#39;s all right, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Of course. Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s a stuffed animal, you know? It&#39;s for kids. Not for adults. I know that.</p><p>Joey, you&#39;re sure? I mean, I knew how much you love him.</p><p>Rachel, let&#39;s be clear on this, okay?</p><p>I do not love Huggsy. I like him a normal amount.</p><p>All right. Well, Emma loves him.</p><p>Yeah. Well, why wouldn&#39;t she? He&#39;s a wonderful person!</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Hey, Phoebe.</p><p>How you doing?</p><p>You felling better?</p><p>Breaking up sucks.</p><p>Oh, I really miss Mike.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p>I&#39;ve tried everything to feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but I can&#39;t think of anything that rhymes with:</p><p>Oh, I so know how you feel. Breaking up with Richard was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life. All right, fine, I&#39;ll put another dollar in the Richard jar.&nbsp;</p><p>Hey, Monica, I&#39;m gonna need your help getting through this.</p><p>You&#39;re saying you&#39;re not gonna need my help?</p><p>No. When I get to the point where I&#39;m ready... to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike, I&#39;m gonna come to you.</p><p>Oh, good, because I&#39;ve already thought of three. Four! I just throught of a fourth!</p><p>Okay. I mean, I know I did the right thing. Mike never wants to get married... and I shouldn&#39;t be a relationship that has no future. But pretty soon, I&#39;m gonna miss him so much... I&#39;m gonna want to see him again, and you have to stop me.</p><p>Okay, you got it.</p><p>Unless... Am I being too crazy about this? All right, so there&#39;s no future. But that doesn&#39;t mean we still can&#39;t have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.</p><p>Really? All right, if that&#39;s what you want.</p><p>That was a test, and you just failed.</p><p>Damn it! Rookie mistake!</p><p>I have sex with dinosaurs?</p><p>I believe I read that somewhere.</p><p>Not only is it not funny, it&#39;s physically impossible! Okay? Depending on the species, I&#39;d have to have a 6-foot-long-- It&#39;s not funny!</p><p>I respectfully disagree.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe you put that on my alumni page.</p><p>Who cares? Nobody reads those.</p><p>You better hope not... because I just read what you put on your page today.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a page.</p><p>Oh, I respectfully disagree!</p><p>Huggsy?</p><p>Huggsy?</p><p>Huggsy.</p><p>I want my penguin.</p><p>Look at you. All sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel.</p><p>With Emma&#39;s chubby little hands wrapped around you.</p><p>It&#39;s okay, Emma. You stay asleep.</p><p>Step away from the crib! I have a weapon!</p><p>It&#39;s okay! It&#39;s okay, Rach! It&#39;s me! Put down the scrunchie.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Well, I heard Emma strring... so I came in to make sure she could reach Huggsy.</p><p>Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that I&#39;m up, I&#39;m gonna go to the bathroom.</p><p>Okay, there you go, sweetie.</p><p>This isn&#39;t over!</p><p>Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone on your class that you are &quot;as gay as the day is long&quot;?</p><p>Because I told everyone he alept with dinosaurs.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s clearly a joke.</p><p>This could easily be true.</p><p>Would you get that, please?</p><p>People have been calling to congratulate me all day.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>No, he&#39;s not here. Yeah, this is his wife.</p><p>Yeah. Well, it came as quite a shock to me too!</p><p>Well, I guess I should&#39;ve known. He just kept making me watch Molin Rouge.</p><p>Hang up! Hang up! And that was a great movie.</p><p>I&#39;m so gonna get back at Ross.</p><p>Oh, yeah, this&#39;ll show him. Here we go.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Oh, you&#39;ll see, my friend!</p><p>I&#39;m dead?</p><p>And so young.</p><p>Posting that I died? That really isn&#39;t funny.</p><p>Well, how you died was funny.</p><p>Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?</p><p>It kills over one Americans every year.</p><p>Unbelievable. My classmates are gonna think I&#39;m dead. My professors. My parents are gonna get phone calls! You&#39;re messing with people&#39;s fellings here.</p><p>You wanna talk about people&#39;s fellings? You should have heard how hurt Prodessor Stern was when I told him I wouldn&#39;t be to go to Key West!</p><p>You&#39;v really crossed a line here. But that&#39;s okay. Because I&#39;m on my way to buy some Photoshop software...and a stack of gay porn. That&#39;s right. Your coming- out is about to get real graphic!</p><p>God, I wish Mike were here.</p><p>Okay, if Mike were here, what should the two of you be doing?</p><p>What are you, animates? It&#39;s 4:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>I gotta call him. Just talk to him. There&#39;s no harm in that.</p><p>That&#39;s how it starts. &quot;I don&#39;t need to eat the cake, I&#39;ll just smell the icing. Why not just a little sliver?&quot; Or, &quot;Okay, just a slice or two.&quot; The next thing you know, you&#39;re 210 pounds... and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide!</p><p>That&#39;s not true, is it?</p><p>They had to cut me out... With the Jaws of Life.</p><p>Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. But look, if you talk to him, then you&#39;re gonna want to see him. And if you see him, you&#39;re gonna wanna get back together. And I konw that&#39;s not what you want.</p><p>All right, so give me your phone.</p><p>Here.</p><p>- And now your cell. - Okay.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>- This is your cell phone? - Yes.</p><p>This is your current cell phone?</p><p>Yes. It reminds me of a simpler time.</p><p>Phoebe? Where&#39;s your purse?</p><p>- Hey! No! - No!</p><p>- Give it to me! - You can&#39;t have it!</p><p>- Give it to me! - No！</p><p>- I&#39;ll go in there! - Oh, yeah.</p><p>- Phoebe, come here! - No!</p><p>- Give it to me! - You&#39;re crazy!</p><p>Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!</p><p>Don&#39;t even think of sneaing out and using a pay phone... bacause I am everywhere, baby!</p><p>Hey, look who&#39;s here.</p><p>It&#39;s Joey. And he brought home a friend.</p><p>Joey! Emma&#39;s right here.</p><p>You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day!</p><p>No, no, no, it&#39;s not a girl. It&#39;s... a brand-new Huggsy!</p><p>Oh! Oh, that&#39;s so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies!</p><p>No, no. Oh, no. No, Emma has one Huggsy. The new Huggsy. The other Huggsy, I don&#39;t know, I guess I&#39;ll just take him back.</p><p>You know what? When I was a little girl, I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh, I loved her so much. I took her everywhere. I would braid her tail--</p><p>Make the transfer!</p><p>Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Huggsy and I can&#39;t find it?</p><p>No, don&#39;t worry about it. I swallowed that years ago. Hey!</p><p>Oh, what? I don&#39;t think she likes the new Huggsy.</p><p>But he&#39;s the same.</p><p>I think she wants the old one back.</p><p>Yeah, but he&#39;s the same.</p><p>Joey, come on.</p><p>But he&#39;s the same!</p><p>You&#39;re not the same.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s a lot less surprising to do that after I&#39;ve buzzed you into the building.</p><p>So, Phoebe, why are there men&#39;s shoes by the door?</p><p>Those are my shoes.</p><p>Well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.</p><p>Look, Monica, I really appricate you checking in on me. But I&#39;m actually felling a lot better.</p><p>You are?</p><p>Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.</p><p>- Who&#39;s that? - I ordered Chinese food.</p><p>What are the chances?! One billion Chinese people, and they send Mike!</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>Phoebe called me.</p><p>- Phoebe1 - I&#39;m sorry. I broke down.</p><p>I wanted to see him.</p><p>Well, not on my watch.</p><p>Damn it, Phoebe, how did you even call him?</p><p>Theres&#39;s a speakerphone on the base unit.</p><p>Base unit. Think, Monica, think!</p><p>- Can I come in? - No! No.&nbsp;</p><p>Phoebe, isn&#39;t seeing Mike exactly what you wanted me to stop you from doing?</p><p>Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--</p><p>This doesn&#39;t concern you!</p><p>Sorry. I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.</p><p>Look, guys, you can&#39;t do this.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna make getting over each other harder.</p><p>Not if nothing happens. Why can&#39;t we just hang out as friends?</p><p>Sure. If you&#39;re just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I&#39;ll join you. You know, I&#39;m your friend and Mike&#39;s friend.</p><p>Sit down.</p><p>Make room for your friend.</p><p>So how have you been?</p><p>I&#39;ve been pretty good.</p><p>You look really beautiful.</p><p>Thinks. You look good too.</p><p>No, no, no. This is dangerous territory. Keep it clean.</p><p>So how&#39;s the piano playing going?</p><p>Actually, I&#39;ve been playing a lot of love songs lately. I&#39;ve missed you.</p><p>I&#39;ve missed you too.</p><p>You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it.</p><p>Hey. Ross.</p><p>Look, I just wanted to apologize. Don&#39;t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.</p><p>Check this out.</p><p>So that&#39;s what I&#39;d look like if I worked out. And was being serviced by a policeman.</p><p>You&#39;re not gonna actually send these out, are you?</p><p>Actually, I don&#39;t need to, because your little &quot;Ross is dead&quot; joke didn&#39;t work. Okay? There were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I&#39;m dead.</p><p>Oh, my God. Nobody cares that I&#39;m dead?</p><p>Oh, come on, you know that&#39;s not true.</p><p>What are you talking about? You get 60 responses... just for coming out of the closet. I didn&#39;t get one response, and I&#39;m dead!</p><p>Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe this. Not even my geology lab partner. And I carried that guy!</p><p>Look, let&#39;s think about this, okay?</p><p>You think people are gonna disturb your family as this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This isn&#39;t about people not caring. This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.</p><p>You&#39;re right. There isn&#39;t a decent outlet.</p><p>Right. I&#39;m sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.</p><p>Exactly!</p><p>Ross, what are you doing?</p><p>You&#39;re having a memorial service for yourself?</p><p>No, that would be stupid. You&#39;re having it for me.</p><p>Ross, don&#39;t press send. Dont&#39;t press--</p><p>No, too late. Too late. It&#39;s sent. Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.</p><p>That&#39;s all right. I&#39;m tan, limber... And it looks like I talked my way out of that ticket.</p><p>The surgery was not a success. And then you say: &quot;What are we gonna do, Drake?&quot;</p><p>Come in.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to put Emma down for a nap. Have you seen Huggsy?</p><p>Original or crappy?</p><p>Original.</p><p>No.Sorry. Haven&#39;t seen him.</p><p>Then what&#39;s that big lump under your covers?</p><p>It&#39;s Monica, okay?</p><p>That&#39;s not Monical!</p><p>All right, fine! It&#39;s orignal Huggsy! I know Emma wants him, but he&#39;s mine and I need him. She&#39;s being unreasonable.</p><p>Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stuid penguin so much! Oh, don&#39;t cover its ears! It&#39;s because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.</p><p>- It does? - Yeah.</p><p>And I think she really likes him because he smells like you. And she-- She loves that. Go figure. And she&#39;s comforted by him necause she loves her Uncle Joey so much.</p><p>- Really? She loves me? -Oh, yeah.</p><p>But you know what? If you need Huggsy, don&#39;t worry. Emma will totally understand. I won&#39;t, but whatever/</p><p>Okay, wait a minute, Rach. I mean, if... If Huggsy means that much to Emma, then... Well, she can have him.</p><p>Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey would step up. Look, Emma. Look who&#39;s back.</p><p>No, forget it! Forget it! I can&#39;t do it!</p><p>Are you--? You&#39;re gonna take Huggsy away from a little child?</p><p>How do you think I got him in the first place?</p><p>And then it just gobbled up that puke. I mean... That was one gross pigeon.</p><p>Oh, man. Why didn&#39;t I ask Joey to keep us apart? You throw a meatball in the hallway, we&#39;d be doing it like rabbits right now.</p><p>All right, you two. I&#39;m gonna go to the bathroom. I don&#39;t want anything going on while I&#39;m gone. Here&#39;s a few things you can discuss: Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.</p><p>I&#39;ve missed you so much. I won&#39;t ask you to get back together. I know we want different things, but... Just to be with you one more night.</p><p>I want that too. But is that gonna make it too hard?</p><p>It can&#39;t be any harder than this. I mean, if had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I-- I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you moved. Everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time... I never would have stopped.</p><p>Kiss him, you fool!</p><p>What?</p><p>Didn&#39;t you hear that speech? If you don&#39;t kiss him, then I will.</p><p>I missed you so much.</p><p>I knew you&#39;d be here!&nbsp;</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>My friend Manny.</p><p>I asked him to keep me away from you.</p><p>Hey, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing for Phoebe.</p><p>Well, you&#39;re not doing a very good job.</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>What&#39;s with the kissing?</p><p>Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.</p><p>Yeah, think God you were here to oversee all the kissing.</p><p>You didn&#39;t hear the speech.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard the speech. If he know it was gonna be the last time--</p><p>Hey, it was vary moving. You&#39;re just heartless!</p><p>You&#39;re weak!&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;re weird!</p><p>Your pants are undone.</p><p>Where&#39;d they go?</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Well, we blew it. I blame myself.</p><p>And I blame you too.</p><p>It&#39;s been an hour, and not one of my classmates has shown up? I tell you, when I actually die, some people are gonna get seriously haunted.</p><p>There you go. Someone came.</p><p>Okay. Okay. I&#39;m gonna go hide. This is so exciting. My first mourner!</p><p>Hi. Glad you could come.</p><p>Please come in.</p><p>HI. You&#39;re Chandler Bing, right? I&#39;m Tom Gordon. I was in your class.</p><p>Oh, yes, let me take your coat.</p><p>Thanks. I&#39;m so sorry about Ross, it&#39;s...</p><p>No, at least he died doing what he loved. Watching blimps.</p><p>Who is it?</p><p>You know some guy, Tom Gordon?</p><p>I don&#39;t remember him. But then again, I touched so may lives.</p><p>So did you know Ross well?</p><p>Actually, I barely knew him. I came because I heard Chandler&#39;s news. Do you know if he&#39;s seeing anyone?</p><p>Yes, he is. Me.</p><p>What? You mean--?</p><p>Can I ask you a personal question? How do you shave your beard so close?</p><p>Okay, Tommy! That&#39;s enough mourning for you. Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.</p><p>Hey, listen. Call me.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I&#39;m dead and no one cares?</p><p>I look like a man?</p><p>Please, one ridiculous problem at a time. This isn&#39;t ridiculous. Look around, no one&#39;s here.</p><p>You gave them one day&#39;s notice. Not everyone checks the website every day. And Monica, it&#39;s probably the way you stand!</p><p>I guess you&#39;re right. Still, somebody must have seen it. I went to that school for four years and I didn&#39;t have an impact on anyone?</p><p>Well, that&#39;s not true. You had an impact on me. I mean, it&#39;s 15 years later and we&#39;re still best friends. Doesn&#39;t that count for something?</p><p>Oh, great, more party bosy for Chandler.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s somebody for you. Now go hide.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m here for Ross Geller&#39;s memorial service.</p><p>Kori? Kori Weston?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You look amazing.</p><p>And you are?</p><p>Chandler. Chandler Bing. And I&#39;m not gay. I&#39;m not gay at all.</p><p>You are married, though.</p><p>Don&#39;t listen to him. He&#39;s in a really bad mood.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know Ross and you were so close.</p><p>Oh, we weren&#39;t. But we had one class together. He was such a great guy. And he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.</p><p>I&#39;m sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door... I&#39;m sure he&#39;s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.</p><p>I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.</p><p>No, you didn&#39;t! I&#39;m still alive!</p><p>Who did we bury?</p><p>Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It&#39;s a long story. But the things you just said really made my day. The fact that you&#39;re here means more to me... than if this room were filled with people.</p><p>You sick freak! Who does that? I can&#39;t believe I had a crush on you.</p><p>Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!</p><p>No, Mom, I am not dead. I know it&#39;s not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it&#39;s over, okay? Actually, no. Even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?</p><p><br/></p><p>====2017.6.8补==========</p><p>浑浑噩噩的当时，想要借助这样的方式来让英语不要淡出自己的视野，就把这一集的台词全打了一遍。2个小时+，很用时间。</p>
